# Dataset
For experiments, we use the data from the original implementation of Neural Hawkes as also synthetic data.
It can be downloaded via [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bu02lcs3wcmh5zk/data.zip?dl=0).
Each dataset is contained in a separate folder with corresponding name. 
Data files are separated into the following splits:
* **Train** : Training the model
* **Dev** : Tuning hyper parameters
* **Test** : Final test and numbers in the paper
* **(Test1)** : Future test
