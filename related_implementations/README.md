# Existing solutions
[THAP: A matlab Tool for HAwkes Processes](https://github.com/HongtengXu/Hawkes-Process-Toolkit) provides functionality for Hawkes Process analysis in MatLab language.
We use this library as inspiration for Granger Causality for Hawkes process implimentation.

[Neural Hawkes](https://github.com/xiao03/nh) is existing PyTorch implementation of Neural Hawkes from original authors of the approach. 
We will use this implementation as a startign point of our own reimplementation. 
It provides simple and understandable solution. 
Moreover, it provides useful datasets for experiments with the model.
