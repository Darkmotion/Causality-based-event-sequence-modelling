# Causality-based-event-sequence-modelling
Implementation of the Casual based Neural Hawkes model as a course project for the Models of Sequential Data course.

# Dataset

Data is taken from the original implementation of Neural Hawkes. 
It can be downloaded via [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwqmV0EcoUc8UklIR1BKV25YR1U?resourcekey=0-OrlU87jyc1m-dVMmY5aC4w&usp=sharing).
Each dataset is contained in a separate folder with corresponding name. 
Data files are separated into the following splits:
* **Train** : Training the model
* **Dev** : Tuning hyper parameters
* **Test** : Final test and numbers in the paper
* **(Test1)** : Future test
